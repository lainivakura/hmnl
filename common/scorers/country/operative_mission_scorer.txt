# Operative mission scorer
#
# Only countries which have a strategy enabling the mission (score >0) will run
# the scorer for the enabled missions.
#
# Before traget_trigger runs, any potential target is first checked for the
# gameplay requirements (e.g. quiet_network mission requires a network over the
# target).
#
# A scorer has to yield a target or the mission will be ignored
#
# operative_mission_no_mission_scorer act as a dummy/example
